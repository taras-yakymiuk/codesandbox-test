# useLocalStorage hook

# **THIS IS A DRAFT/EXAMPLE, NOT READY FOR PROD**

this hook is aimed to solve the next problems

1. create convenient interface for react components via hooks
2. allow react components to catch changes in LS by specific key regardless of where and how components are far from each other (nesting etc.)
3. sync LS across different browser tabs with the same app
